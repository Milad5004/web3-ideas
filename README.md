# Web3 Ideas 💡

A personal repo where I write down random thoughts and ideas about **Web3, crypto, and the future of the internet**.  

## Ideas
- 🌐 A decentralized social network without ads  
- 🎮 Blockchain-based gaming with true item ownership  
- 🪙 Community-driven tokens for small groups  
- 📂 Decentralized cloud storage for personal files  

## Why this repo?
Sometimes I get ideas while reading about crypto.  
This is a place to capture them so I don’t forget and maybe improve them later.
